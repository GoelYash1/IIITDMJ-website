            Life requires us to do more than it requires us to know, in order to function. We believe that it makes more
            sense to teach students how to perform useful tasks rather than delivering them series of lectures. The
            curriculum has been designed to have more number of laboratory courses where students learn through state of
            art equipment and tools. Our curriculum consciously applies methodology and techniques from more than one
            discipline to examine a central theme, issue or a problem.
